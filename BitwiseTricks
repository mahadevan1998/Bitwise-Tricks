1. Sign extension:
Right shifting a signed number to position 0 extends the sign bit to all the bit positions.
Example: +1  = b0000 0001
         -1 = b11111111 (2s complement of +1)
          Now -5 =  11111011   (+5 = 00000101)
          -5>>7 = 11111111; (11111111 = -1)
Conclusion: Right shift a signed number return 0 for +ve numbers and -1 for negative numbers
